  <h1>History</h1>
  <p>Founded in 1950 by brothers Otis and Isaac Bott, Globe Bank launched as a community financial institution with a fervent mission to help small businesses get their footing in the new economy of Postwar England. While the promise of prosperity was rampant, it was unfortunate that those willing to help with financial backing were understandably cautious and scarce.</p>

  <p>The Botts believed in the power of community and ingenuity, so much so that several organizations, even to this day, credit the brothers for both their initial formation and their continued success. Among those businesses in the early days is what we now know as The Landon Hotel chain. As others repeatedly turned down requests for financing from its passionate, but inexperienced founder, Arthur Landon, the Botts appreciated and supported Landon's verve and vision. What started as a single hotel in London's West End, backed by Globe Bank, is now an impressive hotel empire that thrives in cities all around the world.</p>

  <p>More recently, Globe Bank International has received acclaim for its high-profile investment in Winged Achene Technologies, giving it the means to expand from a small specialty helicopter blade company to a transnational rotorcraft resource, expanding not only the company's financial horizons, but creating several thousand sustainable jobs in three cities.</p>

  <p>The Botts' keen instincts for solid investments grew just as swiftly as those companies it supported. In 1974, it moved its home office from London to Washington D.C. to better serve its growing clientele, and changed its name to Globe Bank International. Globe Bank International rapidly became key in corporate, commercial, and investment banking in the United States and internationally, assisting in intercontinental and domestic asset management and growth.</p>

  <p>Still, at its core, Globe Bank International remains a community bank, focusing on the specific needs of individuals and organizations in each community in which its branches are located. Today, Globe Bank is overseen by Otis Bott, President, alongside his son, Gerald Bott, CEO. They have successfully maintained the values and ideals of the family business, despite the bank's tremendous growth over the last half century.</p>
